# mapAnimation
here we are looping through an array of locations with a fat arrow function (ES6) and called a 
setTimeout function every 1 second to show the bus stops between harvard and MIT.

live bus tracker animation


this project utilizes several elements of working with DOM - we are also getting our map from the back end with our self-created Access Token through mapbox GL.

** coming**

i hope to use this same approach in future repos, specifically to animate web pages but also to build applications utilizing the full manipulation offered by these very powerful javascript expressions and loops. this project is exciting for me personally, as i am very interested in public transportation and helping modernize that and make it more efficent in our american cities.



<!-- how to run -->

save files .css .html abd .js locally on your machine in the same directory.  open google chrome and simply drag and drop the index.html file into your    google console.  
   if google chrome is your default browser, you may simply double click the index.html file. 
   the animation will then appear and you will see the eyes following your mouse movements.
